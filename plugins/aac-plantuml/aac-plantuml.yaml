        - name: parsed_model
          type: map
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Output PlantUML component diagram for valid architecture.
          given:
            - The {{puml.input.architecture_file}} contains a valid architecture specification.
            - The {{puml.input.parsed_model}} contains the parsed content from architecture_file.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the puml-component command.
          then:
            - A PlantUML component diagram of the model is printed to the console.

            - The {{puml.input.parsed_model}} contains the parsed content from architecture_file.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the puml-sequence command.
          then:
            - A PlantUML sequence diagram of the use case is printed to the console.

        - scenario: Output PlantUML object diagram for valid model.
          given:
            - The {{puml.input.architecture_file}} contains a valid model specification.
            - The {{puml.input.parsed_model}} contains the parsed content from architecture_file.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the puml-object command.
          then:
            - A PlantUML object diagram of the model is printed to the console.
