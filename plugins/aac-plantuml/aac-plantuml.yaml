  description: aac-plantuml is a Architecture-as-Code plugin that enables Plant UML content to be generated from Arch-as-Code models.
  behavior:
    - name: puml-component
      type: command
      description: Converts an AaC model to Plant ULM component diagram
      input:
        - name: architecture_file
          type: string
          description: Path to a yaml file containing an AaC usecase to generate a Plant ULM component diagram from.
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Output PlantUML component diagram for valid architecture.
          given:
            - The {{puml.input.architecture_file}} contains a valid model.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the puml-component command.
          then:
            - A PlantUML component diagram of the model is printed to the console.

      type: command
      description: Converts an AaC usecase to Plant ULM sequence diagram
      input:
        - name: architecture_file
          type: string
          description: Path to a yaml file containing an AaC usecase to generate a Plant ULM sequence diagram from.
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Output PlantUML sequence diagram for valid use case.
          given:
            - The {{puml.input.architecture_file}} contains a valid model.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the puml-sequence command.
          then:
            - A PlantUML sequence diagram of the use case is printed to the console.

      type: command
      description: Converts an AaC model to Plant ULM object diagram
      input:
        - name: architecture_file
          type: string
          description: Path to a yaml file containing an AaC usecase to generate a Plant ULM object diagram from.
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Output PlantUML object diagram for valid model.
          given:
            - The {{puml.input.architecture_file}} contains a valid model.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the puml-object command.
          then:
            - A PlantUML object diagram of the model is printed to the console.
