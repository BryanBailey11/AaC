  steps:
    - step:  The user invokes doFlow on system.

  participants:
    - name: system
      type: System
    - name: svc1
      type: ServiceOne
    - name: subsystem
      type: Subsystem
    - name: svc3
      type: ServiceThree
  steps:
    - step:  The system has been invoked to doFlow which triggers scv1
      source: system
      target: svc1
      action: ProcessDataA
    - step:  svc1 completes and calls subsystem to continue the flow
      source: svc1
      target: subsystem
      action: processDataB
    - step: subsystem completes and calls svc3 to continue the flow
      source: subsystem
      target: svc3
      action: processDataC
    - step: svc3 completes and provides the result back to system
      source: svc3
      target: system
      action: response
